A guestbook that's not a book but a phone

## Intro

Have you every been at a wedding and filled out a guestbook? How would you describe this experience? Wouln'd a phone, where you can record your guestbook entry on the phone be a nice alternative to those guestbooks? That's exactly what the weddingphone is trying to do.

The weddingphone is an old-fashioned phone, that can be presented at a wedding for guests to record their congratulations on the phone, just like the bridal pair is not at home to answer the phone...

## Usage

Since the project is still a PoC, I don't care that much about user documentation or steps to reuse that project. Once I got a working implementation I might share some insights on the hardware used and how it's made together.

But if you are interested, check out my [docs](docs/index.md) to find some insights.
